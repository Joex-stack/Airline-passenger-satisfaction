# Airline-passenger-satisfaction
🚀 A Machine Learning project that predicts airline passenger satisfaction using demographic, service, and flight data. Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, class imbalance handling (SMOTE), and model evaluation (LogReg, RF, SVM, Boosting) with insights on key factors

Flight Satisfaction Prediction ✈️

A Machine Learning project that predicts passenger satisfaction levels based on flight experience data. The goal is to analyze key service factors and build predictive models that help airlines understand customer needs and improve satisfaction.

✨ Features

📊 Data Analysis – Explored passenger demographics, travel class, flight delays, and service ratings.

🧹 Data Preprocessing – Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.

⚖️ Class Imbalance Handling – Applied techniques like SMOTE to balance satisfaction vs unsatisfaction classes.

🤖 Machine Learning Models – Trained and evaluated models including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Gradient Boosting

📈 Model Evaluation – Compared models using accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.

🔍 Feature Importance – Identified factors that influence satisfaction (e.g., inflight service, seat comfort, delays).
